# ⚡ Customer Churn Prediction 




A modern, interactive Streamlit web application that predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on user-inputted telecom data. Powered by a trained **Random Forest Classifier**, the app also offers a dynamic **churn analytics dashboard** to visualize customer insights.

## 📌 Features

### 🔮 Churn Prediction
- Predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn.
- Takes user input via interactive widgets for all relevant features.
- Displays churn probability and confidence.

### 📊 Dashboard
- Interactive charts to explore churn trends:
  - Churn distribution
  - Churn by contract type
  - Tenure distribution by churn
- Filter customers by gender and contract type.

### 🔧 Model Highlights
- Trained on the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
- Uses `RandomForestClassifier` with `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.
- Full preprocessing pipeline with `StandardScaler` and `OneHotEncoder`.
- Model serialized with `joblib` and integrated into Streamlit app.
